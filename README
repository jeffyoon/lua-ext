I found myself recreating so many extensions to the base lua classes over and over again.
I thought I'd just put them in one place.
I'm sure this will grow out of hand.

Note to users: I often use "require 'ext'" in place of "require 'ext.init'" in my code.
This is courtesy of a LUA_PATH pattern "foo/?/init.lua" in addition to the typical "foo/?.lua".

I'm changing them around to allow its use without muddying up the global environment table.
