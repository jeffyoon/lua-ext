I found myself recreating so many extensions to the base lua classes over and over again
thought I'd just put them in one place
I'm sure this will grow out of hand

note to users: I often use "require 'ext'" in place of "require 'ext.init'" in my code.
this is courtesy of a LUA_PATH pattern "foo/?/init.lua" in addition to the typical "foo/?.lua".
